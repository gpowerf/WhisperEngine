# WhisperEngine

🕯️ A lightweight, gothic-inspired JavaScript engine for building terminal-style text adventures.

## About

**WhisperEngine** is more than a game — it's a foundation for creating immersive, atmospheric, command-line adventures directly in the browser. Originally developed for the project *The Whispering Crypt*, it now serves as a reusable engine for building new stories and interactive experiences.

It’s minimalist, extensible, and written entirely in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS — no build tools, no frameworks.

## Features

- Classic text parser with verb-noun command handling
- Modular room and item architecture
- Puzzle mechanics and conditional logic
- Inventory management
- Dynamic room descriptions and event scripting
- Vibe-first design (green-on-black terminal style, retro typeface, ambient polish)
